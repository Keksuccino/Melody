## IMPORTANT

This mod is a LIBRARY mod.<br>
It will do nothing on its own and its only purpose is to act as a dependency for other mods that use its features.

## About

Melody is an OpenAL-based client-side library mod for playing background music.<br>
It allows you to use OpenAL in Minecraft separated from Minecraft's sound engine and manager.

Melody allows you to (asynchronously) load audio files from all kinds of sources, including web sources.

It has built-in support for OGG and WAV audio files, but there's nothing that prevents you from extending it to support more file types!

To get an idea of how to create ready-to-play audio sources, take a look at Melody's [`SimpleAudioFactory`](https://github.com/Keksuccino/Melody/blob/1.19.4/common/src/main/java/de/keksuccino/melody/resources/audio/SimpleAudioFactory.java) class!

Everything important is documented in the source, so make sure to take a look at [Melody's source on GitHub](https://github.com/Keksuccino/Melody)!
